description: "This trailer platform was created by Martin Gausseran, Lo√Øc Martin, Nicolas Catalano, and me. We used MovieDB queries and the main language for this backend-focused project is PHP. You can create an account and access it in private browsing mode, as it has been deployed for free. It allows you to find the latest trending movies. The complete code is available on my GitHub page. https://flouflix.free.nf/ "
