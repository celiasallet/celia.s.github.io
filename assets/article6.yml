description: "This project is the materialization of a reflection on the concept of mixed heritage, the conflicts it can create, and the tension it evokes. It was developed from interviews with women and serves as the starting point for a deeper exploration of the topic. My primary aim was to present it in order to gather feedback and encourage open dialogue. More to come as the research continues."
