description: "This selection is part of an extensive exploration of image modifications using Illustrator, inspired by my background in fashion design. The images were found at Jeu de Balle or taken in the streets when I first arrived in Brussels. The project integrates knit patterns and shapes, using curve tracers commonly employed in pattern-making to create unique visual compositions."
