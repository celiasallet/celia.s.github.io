description: "This project focuses on developing a graphic identity for an upcycled shirt brand. The logo features tailor scissors to highlight the handmade aspect of the shirts, which are crafted from printed dish towels. I aimed for a minimalist identity that complements the colorful and intricately detailed nature of the shirts without overshadowing them."
