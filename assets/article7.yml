description: "This is a fictional project for a Facebook banner promoting an organ:k party. I created the design using Blender, starting from a drawing made in Procreate. My aim was to capture the essence of the music and techno vibes, inspired by organic materials, such as the interplay of oil in water. Inspiration by @Rich Begany"
